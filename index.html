			<p>"Our destiny as a nation should not stop at Oregon because a body of water - the Pacific is in the way. No. We have the means (physical materials, resources and 
			laws) to push and to explore further from where Lewis and Clark stopped. Now, let's plan for the Pacific and beyond. Let's pledge ourselves to make this an open and 
			a honest endeavor. Let's show the world we can conduct public affairs in a manner worthy of a society that is full of free people - all ages and different races."</p>
	
			<p>My name is Abbey Samuel Laurel-Smith, and I plan to use data and tehnology to ReBuildUSAtoday. But who am i? Well, I am a Radical Republican, 
			and i believe in the values of reconstruction and the benefit such an act brings to the economy, the middle class and the American family. Or let's just say, I 
			believe and trust in the innovative ways of small businesses, the innovative spirit of the ordinary american and the endurance of the middle class.</p>

			<p>Therefore, for the benefit of commerce, agriculture, family budgets, revenue and homeland defense from long endurance weapons of mass destruction and EMP attack, 
			I plan to ReBuildUSAtoday by developing the Pacific (Princess Charllotte's lake) and the Gulf Coast better than we ever did the Atlantic.</p>

			<h1><strong><font color="red">Put me in charge! And watch me ReBuilUSAtoday!</h1></strong></font></p>
	
			<p>To revitalize the economy, I will focus on regional needs, take certain steps and implement community economic rejuvenation policies - that are similar to those 
			implemented for the prosperity of this nation after the civil war.</br>
			Now, let's talk, "economy, the American way" The American civil war showed us how important small businesses are to the growth of this nation. These small businesses 
			are the back bone of many local regions. They create varieties of jobs in our local comunities. They don't have exotic tastes, so no need to ship jobs abroad, talk 
			less of outsourcing services. Small businesses, manufacturers and service providers could help stimulate economic recovery in areas with high unemployment rate. 
			With this in mind, i'd rather give tax breaks to small businesses, inovators and the middle class, than swell big corporations...</p>

			<p>For the West Coast states - California, Washington, Oregon, Utah and Nevada, I will:</br> 
			treat these areas as the frontline of the future of our defense.  And I will do three major things for them. First in the area of defense. Second is technology. And third 
			is waterfarming. But let's talk about the first and the last.</p> 
			
			Defense: Long endurance weapons, aerial/spectrum denial platforms and different types sub-surface weapons with passive anti-buoyancy capability are the biggest threat to 
			the American homeland now. And they are in the hands of aliies and foes in the Pacific. To counter these I propose a review of our current doctrine. Make way fro a deep 
			defense structure by reshuffling our offensive posture. I also propose a new military, a new mindset and a totally new doctrine. We need newly conceived weapons, new weapon 
			platforms and new technology to face this type of challenge. All we have as at know are Reagan-era weapons. They are good for defending Europe and the Middle East. But are 
			they good in the Pacific, No? Are they good for the homeland, No?.</p>

			<p>Technology:
				
				<p>Follow me @The46th_POTUS</p>
			
			<p>For the Gulf Coast and the five south western states, I will:</br>
			introduce waterfarming as the new oil: From now on water from yearly hurricane and flooding of the southern and some midwestern states will be treated as a gift of nature 
			and an asset we could use to replace oil. Mega-reservoirs, mega-drain-pipelines and state of the art water collection and treatment system will turn yearly "disaster water" 
			into something California, Texas, New Mexico, Utah and Arizona farmers could tap into - in times of drought. Treated water pipelines running up to the north and north west 
			corner of America could turn non-agricultural states into a pastural land. Same pipeline could be used to supply fresh water to 3billion people in Bangladesh, India and 
			Indonesia. If we remove the fear of annual disastrous flooding, southern states like Florida, Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi and Texas would counduct business all year long 
			- without fear of disruption.</p>

			<p>For the coal states, I will:</br> 
			sponsor a Congressional charter to pave way for the future of coal states.  If we all remember well, coal and coal producing states have always been there for us since the revolutionary 
			days. These states could still be the basket of the nation for the next fifty years. As the 46th President, i'll borrow a leaf from King Lear's Shakespeare. I'll issue an 
			executive order for the creation of federally owned corporations in these states (from middle America, to the Gulf coast, and California) Focus will be on the creation of 
			small businesses, technology, material technology, water farming, natural disaster control and the developments of new millennial defense structures. This will create enliven 
			a vigorous economic activity throught new jobs and new careers. To encourage ownership and further entreprenural activities, I'll sponsor a Congressional charter for public 
			land bonds.</p>

			<p>For the East Coast, the North and the North eastern states, I will:</br> 
			Healthcare reform we support. Truth is, a single-payer healthcare system puts money back into your pocket. Pay what you can afford. Pay as you go - employed or unemployed. 
			And since you are not through your employer, being out of job does not mean you are out of care with no coverage. No. You are part of a public system that can never be privatized. 
			This is the best way to protect live, family budget and your care when you're old.</p>

			<h1><strong><font color="red">Put me in charge! ...and watch me ReBuilUSAtoday!</h1></strong></font></p>

			<p>And generally for the United States homeland, I will deploy ambient technology and ambience intelligence. With this type of system alone i will be able to:</p>
			<p>tackle infrastructure update.</br>
			<p>improve knowledge and accessibiity to the study of, the reasearch of, and the use of material technology in our schools.</br>
			<p>build roads, buildings, bridges and light our cities with ecologically certified materials.</br>
			<p>turn our cities and every single communal settlements all over the United states into digitally driven smart cities.</br>
			<p>improve survival, reach, capability and efficiency of our military and law enforcement officials.</br></p>

			<p>In the area of education, well, best way to shape and sharpen up our education system is to introduce a tenure system into our colleges of higher institutions. Create a 
			system that will instill an independent reseach capability into the minds of undergrad students. Free college tuition is not a privilege, it is a natural right granted to 
			all born of "the English tongue, so all could practise the art perfected so well by the clergy" since 1072.</p>
